# 📚 Automated Book Publication Workflow – The Gates of Morning

A full-stack AI-powered pipeline that scrapes chapters from public domain texts, rewrites them using LLMs, reviews them with AI feedback, allows human-in-the-loop editing, and stores versions in a semantic search database.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **automated book publication workflow** using AI agents and human collaboration. It supports:

- Web scraping of chapters  
- AI-driven rewriting and reviewing  
- Manual editing with iterative human approval  
- Version control via ChromaDB  
- Semantic retrieval using RL-style embedding search

Built using **Python**, **Playwright**, **ChromaDB**, **SentenceTransformers**, and **HuggingFace Transformers**.

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

### ✅ 1. Scraping & Screenshots
- Chapter scraped from:  
  `https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Gates_of_Morning/Book_1/Chapter_1`
- Screenshot saved to `/screenshots/chapter1_page.png`

### ✅ 2. AI Writing & Reviewing
- `ai_writer.py`: Rewrites chapter using `google/flan-t5-base`  
- `ai_reviewer.py`: Analyzes tone, clarity, grammar, engagement  

### ✅ 3. Human-in-the-Loop Workflow
- `human_loop.py` lets users:  
  - Review AI output  
  - Edit using Notepad/nano  
  - Accept, reject, or revise content  
  - Save versions with metadata  

### ✅ 4. Seamless Agentic Integration
- Fully modular flow:  
  `scrape.py` ➝ `ai_writer.py` ➝ `ai_reviewer.py` ➝ `human_loop.py` ➝ `chroma_handler.py`  
- No manual intervention needed between agents  

### ✅ 5. Versioning + RL Semantic Search
- Final versions stored in `/versions/`  
- Indexed in **ChromaDB** with metadata (author, version, tags)  
- `rl_search.py` allows smart retrieval using `SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")`
